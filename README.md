# FCE Kicad Parts Library
Kicad libraries and footprints

This collection was neglected between May 31, 2015 and August 07, 2021.
It has now been updated with the consolidated mess of stuff I've collected and I hope to get it organized soon.

## Installation and Usage

The FAQ on [Library Management in KiCad version 5](https://forum.kicad.info/t/library-management-in-kicad-version-5/14636) has thorough instructions on installation as well as recommendations on folder structure.
Reading this first is **strongly recommended**.

Either:
* Use git to clone a copy of the file structure in the directory of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlatCapElectronics/kicad-parts
```
* Use the 'Code' button -> 'Download ZIP' option at the top right of this frame and extract into a directory of your choice.

## Contributing
If you find a bug please send me an email. I'm unfamiliar with merging pull requests at the moment and would likely need to establish communication in the event someone sent one.
