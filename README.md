# FCE KiCad Parts Library
This collection was neglected between May 31, 2015 and August 07, 2021.
It has now been updated with the consolidated mess of stuff I've collected and I hope to get it organized soon.

The AC0VD library holds oddball symbols and footprints I've used in projects, and is complimented with the AC0VD.pretty footprints.
The FCE libraries are intended to be generic symbols for EESchema that are more compact than the standard KiCad libraries. This became necessary for working on large analog reverse engineering projects. They are intended to be used with the existing KiCad footprint libraries and refer to them.

This isn't the best way to organize this stuff. I haven't put the time in to brain thinking a best way yet.

## Installation and Usage

The FAQ on [Library Management in KiCad version 5](https://forum.kicad.info/t/library-management-in-kicad-version-5/14636) has thorough instructions on installation as well as recommendations on folder structure.

Reading this first is **strongly recommended**.

Either:
* Use git to clone a copy of the file structure in the directory of your choice.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlatCapElectronics/kicad-parts
```
* Use the 'Code' button -> 'Download ZIP' option at the top right of this frame and extract into a directory of your choice.

If you find a bug please send me an email. I'm unfamiliar with merging pull requests at the moment and would likely need to establish communication in the event someone sent one.
